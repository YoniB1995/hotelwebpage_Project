            Czechia), is characterized as a private body, where free public access is practically impossible (public access is

            the owner and manager of this facility. The mentioned property can be used on the basis of reservation being agreed with

            These house rules are obligatory for hotel guests from the day of conclusion of the accommodation contract (reservation
            of the accommodation) and are its indivisible part. By conclusion of the relevant contract the client confirms that he
            has made himself known and complies with its terms and conditions. Violation of any of these rules entitles the contract
            party to withdraw from the accommodation contract.</p>
